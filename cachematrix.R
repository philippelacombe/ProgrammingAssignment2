## cacheSolve calculates the inverse of the special "matrix"
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
## inverse has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the inverse from the
## cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of
## the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the `setsolve`
## function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(i)
  i
}
